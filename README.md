# Pipeline-Condition-Monitoring-using-ML
* Researched about physics and propagation of UGWs for defect detection in pipelines, including corrosion, cracks, and wall thinning.
* Applied signal processing techniques (time-of-flight, wavelet transforms, sparse reconstruction) to analyze UGW interactions with defects.
* Explored integration of machine learning for automated defect classification and localization, with future directions in digital twins and robotic inspection.
* Used Signal Processing, ML, SHM, Wavelet Transforms.
